Hi,

Unzip and run http://path/xcrud_ci3
Remember to edit xcrud_config.php - assets\vendor\xcrud
Please see/help solve these issues. In codeigniter, the major problem is rendering.


xcrud demos (pure xcrud demos)
Subselect and sum row
-Please see the profit tab calculation

Tabulator Grouping (level 2)
-nothing rendered

Uploads demo
-nothing rendered




CodeIgniter side
=====================
help troubleshoot the rendering of
-buttons panel (showing without labels)
-tabs (only the text shows)
-groups
-general look of forms


Modal & buttons
-buttons (zero height/width). Rendering issue, hover shows button title

Highlights
-field quantityOrdered - are the values supposed to show as the cell is highlighted (This displays same in xcrud demos)

Nested Tables, Nested Tables in Tabs
-what's the difference? The code is exactly the same too.

Parsley Validation
-xcrud_config.php a search for "parsley" finds "0" results
-of course this demo does not work too

Tooltips
-Not rendering
